Make sure you don’t delete or write over the speech\r\nmarks.\r\nClick on the ‘knit’ command at the top of the pane. After a short\r\nwait you will see the output file of your work. Can you see your name on\r\nthe output file?\r\nIf you can see your name, close the output file by clicking on X.\r\nIf you cannot see your name, drag the output file to the side so that\r\nyou can see what you wrote in the Markdown file. Check you typed your\r\nname correctly. Check that there are speech marks around your name. Knit\r\nyour Markdown document again. Has your name been printed? If so, close\r\nthe output file by clicking on X.\r\nTyping in the code chunk\r\nWhen you write code in the code chunk, R will carry out the commands.\r\nCode chunks are named r chunk1, r chunk2 etc. You must write your code\r\nin the lines between the top row of\r\nand the bottom row of.\r\nWe will tell R to do a calculation for us. Type 10 + 2 into the code\r\nchunk. Click on the little arrow on the right of the code chunk to tell\r\nR to carry out the command.\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nDid R give you the correct answer?\r\nNow you make up an addition sum and type it into code chunk2. Don’t\r\nforget to click on the arrow on the right to run your code.\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nNow click on knit. Read through your output file to check that your\r\nsums are printed.\r\nExtension\r\nTry typing in some more calculations. Try a subtraction calculation\r\nor a multiplication calculation. (Use the symbol * for multiply). Type\r\nin code chunk3, chunk4 and chunk5 below.\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nMystery code\r\nI wonder what this code tells R to do.\r\nCarefully copy and paste the following lines of code into code chunk\r\n6. Run the code. What do you see?\r\nx <- seq(1,128,1) y <- sin((x / 128.0) * pi) n <- 7 color\r\n<- rainbow(n, s = 1, v = 1, start = 0, end = max(1, n - 1)/n, alpha =\r\n1) plot(x, y, type=“n”, ylim = c(0,10)) for(i in 1:7) {lines(x, y+i,\r\ncol=color[i], lwd = 15)}\r\n\r\n[1] FALSE\r\n\r\nKNIT YOUR DOCUMENT for the final time. This will be the version of\r\nyour work that your teacher will check.\r\nWell done! You have completed your first R lesson.\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\nLicense and Citation: You can use, modify, and adapt\r\nany of the lessons, but please include the following attribution:\r\nRGirls Community.
