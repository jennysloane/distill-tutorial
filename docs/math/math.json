Knit for the final time\r\nwhen you have completed the lesson. This final output file will be the\r\none your teacher marks.\r\nWrite your code in the code chunks.\r\nYou can run your R code chunk in the Markdown file by clicking on the\r\nlittle arrow on the right of the chunk.\r\nWhat is a box plot\r\nA box plot is a way to show the shape or distribution of a set of\r\ndata. It shows five useful features of the data, known as the five\r\nnumber summary.\r\nMinimum - the smallest valueÂ  Maximum - the largest value\r\nMedian - the middle or 50% value\r\nLower quartile - the value half way between the minimum and the median\r\nor 25% value\r\nUpper quartile - the value half way between the median and the maximum\r\nor 75% value\r\nThe difference between the upper and lower quartile is known as the\r\ninter-quartile range (IQR)\r\nWorked Example 1\r\nZaynab keeps a record of her journey times to school each morning.\r\nThe times are to the nearest minute:\r\n29,21,16,25,21,19,18,30,21,21,12,26,19,21,20,19,30,29,16,21,18,18,27,18,20\r\nLet us draw a box plot and obtain the five number summary and the\r\ninter-quartile range (IQR). We will do this in three steps.\r\nThe R code in chunk1 tells R to store all the times into a variable\r\ncalled y and then to use these times to draw a box plot of the data.\r\n\r\n\r\ny <- c(29,21,16,25,21,19,18,30,21,21,12,26,19,21,20,19,30,29,16,21,18,18,27,18,20)\r\nboxplot(y, xlab=\"Times (mins)\", horizontal=T)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo help us read values from the box plot it is useful to have\r\ngridlines on the plot.\r\nHere is a simple trick to get gridlines on the plot.\r\nThe code in chunk2 tells R to use the numbers it store in variable y\r\nto draw a box plot and then to add grid lines.\r\nClick on the little arrow on the right of the code chunk. The box\r\nplot will be drawn below the chunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n# we can calculate the five number summary like this\r\nboxplot(y, xlab=\"Times (mins)\", horizontal=T)\r\nGrid()\r\nboxplot(y, xlab=\"Times (mins)\", horizontal=T, add=T)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can also get R to calculate the five number summary for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n# we can calculate the five number summary like this\r\nsummary(y) # five number summary but also provides the mean\r\n\r\n   Min. 1st Qu.
