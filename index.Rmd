# Welcome!

We are delighted to announce that we are setting up a worldwide network to promote the use of R - a leading data science programming language - in secondary schools for girls.

This site is aimed primarily at teachers who want to use R in their lessons. On this website, you can find details on:

- Getting Started
- Ready made Math, Science and Geography lessons.
- Or, join us for a friendly chat on Slack
